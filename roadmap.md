# Floor Plan Drawing Tool Enhancement Plan (Excalidraw-based)

## Technology Stack
- Core Drawing Library: Excalidraw
- Frontend Framework: React (as Excalidraw is React-based)
- PDF Handling: PDF.js
- Styling: CSS-in-JS (as used by Excalidraw)
- Build Tool: Create React App or Next.js

## 1. Excalidraw Integration
- [ ] Set up a new React project
- [ ] Install and integrate @excalidraw/excalidraw package
- [ ] Implement basic Excalidraw canvas in the application

## 2. PDF Integration
- [ ] Add file input for PDF selection
- [ ] Implement PDF to image conversion using PDF.js
- [ ] Display PDF image as background in Excalidraw canvas

## 3. Custom Shape Library
- [ ] Extend Excalidraw's shape library with floor plan specific elements (e.g., walls, doors, windows)
- [ ] Implement custom controls for these new shapes

## 4. Pattern and Fill Management
- [ ] Develop a library of floor plan specific patterns and textures
- [ ] Extend Excalidraw's fill capabilities to support these patterns
- [ ] Implement pattern scale and rotation adjustments
- [ ] Add transparency control for fills

## 5. Enhanced Properties Panel
- [ ] Extend Excalidraw's properties panel to include floor plan specific attributes
- [ ] Add controls for:
  - [ ] Custom pattern selection
  - [ ] Pattern scale and rotation
  - [ ] Fill transparency
  - [ ] Floor plan specific properties (e.g., wall thickness, door swing)

## 6. PDF Export
- [ ] Implement PDF export functionality that includes the background PDF and drawn elements
- [ ] Ensure correct pattern rendering in export
- [ ] Match exported PDF dimensions and resolution to original

## 7. Multi-page PDF Support
- [ ] Implement navigation between multiple PDF pages
- [ ] Allow drawing on each page separately

## 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large floor plans
- [ ] Implement efficient handling of large PDFs

## 9. Labeling and Annotation
- [ ] Extend Excalidraw's text capabilities for floor plan specific labeling
- [ ] Implement area calculation for closed shapes

## 10. Collaboration Features
- [ ] Implement real-time collaboration using Excalidraw's collaboration feature

## 11. Undo/Redo and Version History
- [ ] Utilize Excalidraw's built-in undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Implement version history for floor plans

## 12. Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure the tool works well on various screen sizes and touch devices

## 13. Accessibility
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Ensure the application is screen reader friendly

## 14. Dark Mode
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle using Excalidraw's theming capabilities

## Key Challenges to Address
- Seamlessly integrating PDF background with Excalidraw canvas
- Extending Excalidraw's shape library and properties panel without breaking its core functionality
- Ensuring custom patterns and textures render correctly in both the canvas and exported PDF
- Optimizing performance for large, complex floor plans
- Maintaining PDF resolution and dimensions in export

## Future Enhancements
- 3D view generation from 2D floor plan
- Integration with popular CAD software
- AI-assisted room layout suggestions
