# Floor Plan Drawing Tool Enhancement Plan

## 1. PDF Loading
- [ ] Add file input for PDF selection
- [ ] Implement PDF to image conversion using PDF.js
- [ ] Display PDF image as background in Konva stage

## 2. Layer Management
- [ ] Create background layer for PDF image
- [ ] Implement pattern layer
- [ ] Add drawing layer for user-created shapes

## 3. Drawing Functionality
- [ ] Implement box drawing tool (click and drag)
- [ ] Create polygon drawing tool (multi-point click)
- [ ] Add shape editing capabilities (move vertices, resize)

## 4. Pattern and Fill Management
- [ ] Develop a library of fill patterns
- [ ] Create pattern selection tool
- [ ] Implement pattern scale and rotation adjustments
- [ ] Add transparency control for fills

## 5. Shape Properties
- [ ] Design and implement properties panel for selected shapes
- [ ] Add controls for:
  - [ ] Fill pattern selection
  - [ ] Pattern scale and rotation
  - [ ] Fill transparency
  - [ ] Outline color and thickness

## 6. Rendering
- [ ] Utilize Konva's pattern fill capabilities
- [ ] Implement custom shaders for complex patterns (if needed)
- [ ] Optimize rendering for zoom and pan operations

## 7. Export as PDF
- [ ] Capture entire stage (PDF background + patterns + drawings)
- [ ] Generate new PDF with jsPDF
- [ ] Match new PDF dimensions and resolution to original
- [ ] Ensure correct pattern rendering in export

## 8. User Interface
- [ ] Add tools for shape drawing (polygon, box)
- [ ] Design and implement pattern selection interface
- [ ] Create properties panel for shape attribute adjustments
- [ ] Develop controls for PDF loading and export

## 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize pattern rendering
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently used patterns
- [ ] Ensure efficient handling of large PDFs

## 10. Undo/Redo Functionality
- [ ] Implement undo/redo for all drawing and editing actions

## Key Challenges to Address
- Efficient rendering of complex patterns
- Smooth interaction when editing shapes with patterns
- Ensuring pattern quality at different zoom levels
- Correct pattern rendering in PDF export
- Maintaining PDF resolution and dimensions
- Handling multi-page PDFs
- Ensuring good performance with large files
